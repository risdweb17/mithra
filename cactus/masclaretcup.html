	  	<h3>Claret Cup Cactus</h3>
	  	<br>
	  	<div class="textinright">
	  	<p>A small barrel-shaped cactus. Plant generally forms from a few to hundreds of spherical to cylindrical light- to bluish green stems in more or less round, large, dense mounds. The orange to red waxy flower is funnel-shaped 8 to 9 centimeters. The plant is densely spiny and somewhat woolly. Spines fall off readily or seasonally. The fruit is juicy and edible with deciduous spines.
	  		<br><br>The plants grow in gravelly soils in grasslands, shrublands, pinyon/juniper, or aspen communities. The plants often grow against a rocky outcrop or within the rocky outcrop. Plants occur from three thousand and twenty to seven thousand nine hundred and fifty feet in elevation.<br><br>
	  		There is a thick nectar chamber and many thready pink stamens at the center of the corolla. The flowers are pollinated by hummingbirds. Hummingbirds are the primary pollinators and must stick their entire head into the flower to reach the nectar chambers at the flower's base. In the process, the hummingbird's forehead gets dusted with pollen. (Sometimes they look like another species of hummingbird!) The flowers stay open at night, unlike many other species of cacti whose flowers close in the evening. The flowers last three to five days.<br><br>http://www.desertusa.com/flowers/hedgehog-claret-cup.html</p>
